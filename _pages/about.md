I am a graduate student in the Applied Mathematics department broadly 
interested at the intersection of theoretical neuroscience and machine 
learning. Currently, I am using frameworks from statistical learning to 
model and make inferences about randomly connected sparse neural systems 
in insect model organisms. During my undergraduate years, I used manifold 
learning methods and dynamical systems theory to visualize and verify the 
theoretically predicted ring attractor present in the mammalian head 
direction system. In my free time, I love making delectable dishes 
in the kitchen, bumping hip-hop music, and hiking difficult trails.



## Bio
I grew up in Nepal! I came to America when I was a wee lad. 

I did an REU at ICERM. I did a stint in Hong Kong with a startup. 

In my free time, I enjoy listening to hiphop music and debating about it.
