 I am an applied mathematician broadly interested at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. I am driven to uncover the algorithms underlying human/animal cognition. Taking inspiration from algorithms, I want to build more efficient and robust machine learning systems. 

Right now, I am a 3rd year PhD student at University of Washington in the Applied Mathematics department. I am advised by [Bing Brunton](https://www.bingbrunton.com/) and [Kameron Decker Harris](https://glomerul.us/index.html). Currently, I am working on determining inductive biases - constraints in connectivity and learning mechanisms - used by sensory and motor circuits to inform deep learning methods. I am also interested in understanding why deep learning works. I find the mathematical techniques and ideas in deep learning theory aesthetically pleasing.

I did my undergraduate at UT Austin where I studied neuroscience and pure mathematics. My research advisors were [Ila Fiete](https://fietelab.mit.edu/) and [Rishidev Chaudhuri](https://chaudhurilab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/). We used manifold learning methods, topological data analysis and good ol’ fashioned dynamical systems theory to visualize and verify the theoretically predicted ring attractor present in the mammalian head direction system.

## Bio
I am originally from Nepal. I grew up in the capital, [Kathmandu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu). My parents and I immigrated to the lonestar state (TX) in summer 2010. I have a sibling who’s doing his PhD in Physics at the University of Chicago. We try to keep the rivalry to a minimum ;). In my off time, I really enjoy listening to music and devouring books. I consider myself a hip-hop connoisseur. Some of my favorite artists in no particular order are [Nas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkplck1CmEc), [Jay-Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XVILqApxXM), [Rapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLGFIjMEFBE), [Travis Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJWHAiDARMQ), and [Drake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t195yz9xCc). I’m also huge fan of the [Joe Budden Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC23_r1bpkTWaBltbXsQxysA)! Cooking is another thing I really enjoy and want to get better at. Since moving to Seattle, I have grown a love for hiking and spending time outdoors. If you want to chat about science or just vibe, please reach out. I thoroughly enjoy meeting and talking to new people!
