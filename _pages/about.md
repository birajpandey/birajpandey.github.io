I'm an applied mathematician interested broadly at the intersection of neuroscience and applied mathematics.

I did my undergrad at UT Austin with Ila Fiete. Now, I am in Bing Brunton's group where I construct efficient deepl learning methods.



## Bio
I grew up in Nepal! I came to America when I was a wee lad. 

I did an REU at ICERM. I did a stint in Hong Kong with a startup. 

In my free time, I enjoy listening to hiphop music and debating about it.
