I didn't grow up with a dog. Or any pets, for that matter. This summer I visited my partner, Caitlin and her family for ~3 weeks in Ohio. There I met the bestest boy in the world, Mordecai! He's a 10 lb Shih Tzu-Yorkie mix full of life...as long as it's after 8 am. My first post is a tribute to you Mordy. I miss you so much and can't wait to visit you again!
